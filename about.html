    <h3 id="phead">Why Final Projects?</h3>
    <div class="p">
        The inspiration for this project came when I realized there was no central repository for our boot camp final projects. These Promineo Tech final projects are no joke! <em>It is a lot of difficult work to 
        make a project such as this happen from scratch.</em> In my observation, we often got into our own little coding bubble and put so much of ourselves into project completion and debugging that we forgot (or ran out 
        of time) to celebrate the project itself and the skills we had to learn to get things done.
    </div>

    <div class="p">
        Many times along my journey, I would see someone working in office hours, trying to fix a problem in their code. There was great joy and relief when a typo was spotted, or a solution was found. There were 
        many laughs (after the fact, not during) when it turned out to be one of the stupid mistakes we all make from time to time--like the pesky 's' or the missing space in a SQL statement. Once the problem was 
        solved, we went back to work and the rest of the group rarely got to see the finished product. While I worked on my own project, I also looked up other projects on github to see how someone did something 
        I wanted to emulate, but many times I came away frustrated when I couldn't find exactly the right thing, even though I knew there was somebody out there who had attempted it.
    </div>

    <div class="p">
        So here's a place where we can proudly submit our projects for others to check out, whether it is for help with code, to find a new idea, or just to celebrate a person whose efforts did not go unnoticed 
        during the boot camp!
